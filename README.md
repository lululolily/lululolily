# Introduction
My name is Tengku Puteri Emilia binti Tengku Nazaruddin Shah, a final year Software Engineering student in University of Malaya. Nice to meet you! My GitHub is currently full of repositories that I've worked on throughout all the courses that I took for 3 years I have been here.

## About Me
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my final year project mobile application for flight crew personal assistant system called FlyPal, I worked on this project with my partner and we use M.E.R.N stack, React Native frameworks and Expo Go for application establishment. We haven't yet deployed the application since it's still currently in development.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on how to work for my final year project using React Native frameworks and I usually learnt through multiple resources, either from repositories that I found on Github or YouTube or Overstackflow, sometimes I would use A.I as my helping tool if I couldn't figure out how to do it.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that could boost my coding and development skills especially using Python or C language.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my final year project from anyone that could be able or willing to help me analyze my errors.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to Machine Learning or Web Programming or Mobile App Development because I already took those 3 courses before and I am really interested to delve in them deeper.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: 
1. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tgputeriemilia/)
2. [E-mail](mailto:tgputeriemilia@gmail.com)

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her

âš¡ Fun fact: I actually enjoy when people guide me to understand better about coding with easier and better explanations and letting me explore more on their projects.
